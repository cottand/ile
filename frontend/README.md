# package frontend

A significant part of this package is forked off `github.com/wdamron/poly`.

Credit to [wdamron](https://github.com/wdamron) for
their implementation of a HM type system with extensible records
(based on [this paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/extensible-records-with-scoped-labels/)).
I am very grateful that they open-sourced their design.

I have included their copyright notice in the `LICENSE` file,
and plan preserve their license for this package.
